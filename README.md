A collection of the projects I have completed on my data journey

## [Project 1: Sales Prediction Model](https://github.com/snicole2701/Sales-Prediction-Model)

For my latest project, I leveraged a dataset detailing weekly expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising, along with the resulting sales figures. I developed a linear regression model to analyze the impact of spending on each advertising medium on total sales, utilizing Python in Visual Studio Code for this analysis.

Following the model creation, I crafted an interactive dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard allows users to input various spending amounts for each advertising channel, dynamically updating to predict total sales based on these inputs. The dashboard also calculates the total cost of advertising and the predicted sales.

### Key features of this interactive dashboard include:

The ability to toggle spending amounts for TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising.

Real-time updates to predicted sales as spending amounts are adjusted.

Comprehensive calculations powered by DAX measures to showcase the relationship between advertising spend and sales outcomes.
